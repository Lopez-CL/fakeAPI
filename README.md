#FakerAPI Assignment

**Assignment Details:** This basic project utilizes two JS libraries (Express & Faker) to practice building a server that handles get requests for data in the Faker API. I used Postman to test get all requests which do one of the following, depending on the path/route used:

-Generate random user data
-Generate random company data
-Generate random company & user data
